In this project, I worked collaboratively with Prof Alexander Schwing to help him interface a library that he has written from his research. His library is written in C but he would  also like to take advantage of the scientific library "Torch" which is written for Lua. For that reason, I helped in interfacing the C library so that its functions can be called from Lua.
